    <summary>WinCompose - A compose key for Windows</summary>
    <description>A compose key allows to easily write special characters such as é ž à ō û ø ☺ ¤ ∅ « ♯ ⸘ Ⓚ ㊷ ♪ ♬ using short and often very intuitive key combinations. For instance, ö is obtained using o + ", and ♥ is obtained using &lt; + 3. I wrote WinCompose because I found none of the alternatives (FreeCompose, CKFW, AllChars or Unichars) to be satisfying.</description>

    <releaseNotes>This release provides important usability and compatibility improvements:

    * WinCompose now detects keyboard layout changes and adapts instantly
    * keyboards with an AltGr key are handled properly, even when it acts as the Compose key.
    * sequences containing the compose key itself are now possible, for instance ComposeComposecake for :cake:.
